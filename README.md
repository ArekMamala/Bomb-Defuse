## Bomb Defuse
We have chosen to design a 2D game it’s called “Bomb Defuse ”. This game makes the player think and act under pressure, it tests the players never, The player receives instructions and steps on how to go about defusing the bomb that he gets displayed with. The bomb consists of few steps that are needed to be accomplished before the bomb is defused.

### How to run the game
Download the Bomb-Defuse folder and open it with unity. 

#### How to play the game
1. Player needs to cut the right wire to unlock the next part of the bomb but every time that the wrong wire is cut the time on
the timer gets decreased by half. User can only make one mistake with the wires.
2. Once the right wire is cut the code that needs decrypting will appear to the user. User needs to follow the bomb manual.
3. When the code is decipher and user has the correct code he enters it and wins the game. If the wrong code is entered the
bomb will explode and ending the game on a defeat
The overall design of the game will be designed by the developers the assets e.g. wires, timers. We will try not to use any assets
from the asset store and make it more difficult for ourselves and give ourselves a bit more work to make it original and make the
game ourself.
